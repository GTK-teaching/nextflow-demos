# Make Files

A basic demonstration that creates files based on a list of sample ID's, then passes them to another process which prints the file contents to the terminal.

## Usage

Pipeline can be run using the included `Makefile` with the command:

```
make run
```

## Output

The terminal output should look like this:

```
$ make run
export NXF_VER="0.28.0" && \
	curl -fsSL get.nextflow.io | bash
